Hi, I'm Sybe and this is my Portfolio space for Mastering Tinkering. 
The assignments are structured per session and can be found in the corresponding folder.
For the longer pdf's, make sure to click 'more pages' at the bottom of the document to see all pages.

If you read this: I'm currently working hard on finishing up everything :')
